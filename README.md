# Layoffs Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and exploring a layoffs dataset using MySQL. The dataset contains information about company layoffs, including metrics like location, industry, total layoffs, layoff percentages, and funding-related details. The goal of this project is to ensure the dataset is clean, standardized, and ready for analysis while uncovering key insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Steps in Data Cleaning
The following steps were taken to clean and prepare the data:

### 1. Check for Duplicates
- **Objective**: Identify and remove duplicate records to ensure the dataset contains only unique entries.

### 2. Standardize Data and Fix Errors
- **Objective**: Ensure consistent data formats and correct any inaccuracies.

### 3. Handle Null Values
- **Objective**: Address missing data effectively.

### 4. Remove Unnecessary Columns and Rows
- **Objective**: Simplify the dataset by removing irrelevant or redundant information.

### 5. Replace Null Values
- **Objective**: Replace missing data with logical defaults to ensure completeness.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following exploratory analyses were performed on the cleaned dataset:

### 1. Industry-wise Analysis
- **Goal**: Find the total number of layoffs and the average percentage of layoffs by industry.
- **Insights**:
  - Identified industries with the highest layoffs.

### 2. Country-based Analysis
- **Goal**: Analyze layoffs by country and identify the country with the most layoffs.
- **Insights**:
  - Highlighted the countries most affected by layoffs.

### 3. Funding vs. Layoffs
- **Goal**: Examine if companies with higher funds raised tend to have more layoffs.
- **Insights**:
  - Explored the correlation between funding levels and layoff counts.

### 4. Stage-wise Analysis
- **Goal**: Compare the average percentage of layoffs across different funding stages.
- **Insights**:
  - Identified stages of funding with higher layoff percentages.

### 5. Timeline Analysis
- **Goal**: Trend analysis of layoffs over time.
- **Insights**:
  - Analyzed the timeline of layoffs to identify peaks and trends.

### 6. Top Companies with Layoffs
- **Goal**: Identify the top 10 companies with the highest number of layoffs.
- **Insights**:
  - Highlighted companies with the most significant layoff events.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Database**: MySQL
- **IDE**: MySQL Workbench
- **Visualization**: Tableau (used for additional exploratory visualizations) **(https://public.tableau.com/shared/YKHYHNNZ3?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

## Future Work
- Incorporate advanced analysis techniques, such as predictive modeling for future layoffs.
- Explore more granular trends, such as layoffs by company size or funding status.
- Enhance visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
